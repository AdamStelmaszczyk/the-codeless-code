Name: Laughing Monkey Clan
Lang: en
Translator: qi

Specialists in the business tier, where monkey business
usually happens.  Members of this clan have a traditional
fighting style which involves throwing wrenches at their
opponents; this is tolerated because it is not the /worst/
thing that Monkeys have been known to throw.

There is a theory that an finite number of Laughing
Monkeys pounding away randomly at an finite number of
keyboards will eventually get a clean compile.  The existence
of the Standard PHP Library would seem to imply that this has
already happened.
