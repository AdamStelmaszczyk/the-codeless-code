Name: Elephant's Footprint Clan
Lang: en
Translator: qi

Specialists in the persistence tier, where the Temple's most
precious resource is managed -- by which I mean data, not
alcohol, although they have a fair amount of that as well to
cope with the stress of Temple life.  Despite this, the clan
has strict rules regarding inebriation.  A monk is
absolutely /not/ allowed to code while drinking unless he
really, really wants to.  Any monk caught violating this
rule is punished by having to buy the next round.

The clan takes its name from the immense ivory-panelled
server cabinet which houses the Temple's most venerable DBMS
hosts.  This cabinet is known affectionately as the Great White
Elephant, no doubt for its flawless memory.  However it
is worth noting that elephants /do/ sometimes forget, which
is why the Temple has hot replication to a colocation site
which houses the Emergency Backup Elephant.
