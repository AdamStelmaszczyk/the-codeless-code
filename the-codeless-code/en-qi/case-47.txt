<div class="footnote"><sup>*</sup> Some observations by the Editor:</div>
<ul>
<li>This means that every
    binary number has both sex chromosomes, except for numbers
    of the form (2^n)-1 where n&nbsp;&gt;=&nbsp;0.</li>
<li>It also means that bitwise complement (~) is the Sex-Change Operation.</li>
<li>It would be natural to assign gender to binary integers as follows:
    even numbers (ending in 0) are female, and odd numbers
    (ending in 1) are male.
    But speaking personally, I would find it disconcerting if someone
    referred to the anatomical feature that defines my sexuality as
    my Least Significant Bit.
