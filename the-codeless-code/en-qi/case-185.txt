Title: Social Media Comment Compression

Tagline: In which we spread a social disease.

Social media is consuming resources at an alarming rate.{{1}}
Every day, users post roughly 40 million tweets
and 3.5 /billion/ Facebook messages /alone/ . . . in
addition to which we have Google Plus, Kinja, Reddit,
LiveJournal{{2}}, and so on!

Fortunately, semantic analysis of the traffic reveals a /staggering/
amount of duplication.  So to reduce bandwidth consumption, storage space,
and work hours lost to "texting thumb",{{3}}
I propose a <b>new standardized menu</b> that reduces each
social media comment to a simple five-bit number (0 to 31):

<ol start="0">
<li> "Like" (or “Plus 1”)
<li> "Hate" (or “Minus 1”)
<li> "Whatever" (or “Times 1”)
<li> tl;dr
<li> LOL
<li> SMH
<li> LOLSMH
<li> ZOMGROTFLMAOSMH <i>[don't try this IRL].</i>
<li> Obligatory <a href="http://xkcd.com">XKCD</a>.
<li> Irrelevant trivia.
<li> Snark.
<li> Boojum.
<li> A picture of your lunch.
<li> A picture of your junk.
<li> A picture of the "that's enough internet for today" cat.
<li> "Firefly" quote.
<li> Pun.
<li> Worse pun.
<li> Small unfunny joke made at expense of absent partner/spouse, giving readers a glimpse into the seething bitterness underlying your joyless relationship.
<li> Creepy attempt at flirting, via sexual innuendo followed by ;-)
<li> Clumsy attempt to cover up flirting, via "j/k" followed by ;-)
<li> Trolling.
<li> Vaguebooking.
<li> Sycophantic mollycoddling <i>[now illegal in Indiana].</i>
<li> Drunken confession <i>[adjust security settings to disable].</i>
<li> Sweeping generalization.
<li> #NotAll___.
<li> Observation that /YOUR/ gender/religion/political party does something /EVEN WORSE./
<li> Argumentum Ad Hominem.
<li> F-bombs away!
<li> Invocation of Godwin's Law <i>[automatically ends thread].</i>
<li> I made $6400/week working at home, using this one trick invented by a mom to enlarge your penis: ask me how! {{4}}

{{2}} No, really, LiveJournal is still around.  Snopes confirmed it.
{{3}} "Texting Thumb" is a thing that is real.  It's formally known as <a href="http://ergonomics.about.com/od/De-Quervains_Syndrome/a/What_Is_Texting_Thumb.htm">De Quervain's Syndrome</a>.
{{4}} 90% of all Internet traffic is this, according to a statistic that I made up just now.
