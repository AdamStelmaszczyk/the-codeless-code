Illus.0.title: Everyone at the Temple lives in dread of the day when she needs a wheelchair instead of a cane.  Getting hit with a wheelchair REALLY hurts.

A certain monk was known throughout the Temple for his
humility.  When discussing flaws in his clan's software he
always took personal responsibility, yet when receiving praise
for marvelous features crafted by him alone, he always gave
credit to the entire team.  Eventually word of the monk came
to old [[Jinyu]], Abbess over all Clans and Concerns.

"So," she said to her chief abbot, "this monk says <i>I failed</i>
after the defeats of others, and <i>we triumphed</i> after his own
victories?"

"So it is said throughout the Temple," said the abbot.

"Bring him to me," commanded Jinyu.

When this was done, Jinyu surprised all in attendance by
striking the monk with her cane and sentencing him to thirty
days' hard labor in the data mines.  After the stunned monk
had been taken away the abbot nervously approached Jinyu to
inquire the reason.

Jinyu struck the abbot.  "Fool!  Consider the monk's algorithm.
When he says <i>I failed</i>, what is most probably the truth?"

"That others have failed," said the abbot, flinching.

Jinyu struck him again. "And when the monk says <i>we triumphed</i>,
what does he most likely mean?"

"That victory was his alone," said the abbot, wincing in pain.

The ancient priestess twirled her cane overhead, so fast
that the very air whined in anguish, until with a
thunderclap she brought it down hard on the floor
in front of the terrified abbot.  "The only thing
praiseworthy about this boastful monk is that he has
mastered the art of one-to-one mapping.  Meanwhile, what am
I to do with the rest of you idiots?  You were
deceived by a simple substitution cipher <i>that your brains
had already decoded</i>."
