A young monk asked master [[Kaimu]], "Other than technical
proficiency, what is one essential quality for a master to
have at all times?"

Kaimu answered   "Kindness."

The monk asked, "When [[Banzen]] corrected me with his staff,
who was he being kind to? "

Kaimu answered  "Your future self."

The monk asked, "When [[Suku]] denied me a leadership post,
who was she being kind to?"

Kaimu answered, "Our temple and our customers."

The monk said, "Last week, [[Bawan]] sent an applicant
plummeting off the cliffside tower for falsifying his resume.
There were no customers, no temple, and now no
future self.  Who was Bawan being kind to?"

Kaimu answered,  "The world."
