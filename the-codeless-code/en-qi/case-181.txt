Illus.0.title: By a strange coincidence, after writing this case I found out that Leonard Nimoy tweeted this quote just before he died: "A life is like a garden.  Perfect moments can be had, but not preserved, except in memory."


[[#180|This same nun]] visited [[Shinpuru]] in his
garden the following day, where the monk was doing the last
of his winter weeding.

"You spoke to me of looking to the future," said the nun.
"But what are we in the future but mouldering corpses?  Why,
you are practically half a corpse now!  I have seen how you
let younger monks lead the projects you are offered.  You
voice no objection when these upstarts choose arcane new
technologies that render your decades of knowledge
irrelevant -- instead you struggle to catch up, and contribute
less each year than the year before!  Why should I follow
you when you walk willingly into your own grave?"

Shinpuru pulled a withered stalk, gave it to the nun, and
said, "This will not suit my garden.  For though it still
clings to life, it will steal water from the seedlings and
bear only bitter fruit."

Shinpuru then put his ear to a second stalk, identical to the
first.  After a moment he nodded.  "This one can stay, for
it wishes only to be part of a sweet harvest."  He pulled
the second stalk, crumpled it in his hands, and tilled the flakes
deep into the soil to await the coming of spring.
