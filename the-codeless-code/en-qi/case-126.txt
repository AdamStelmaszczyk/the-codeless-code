Illus.0.title: Stop looking up her robes.  Yes, I'm talking to YOU.

Like many her age, the young nun [[Satou]] had an
irrepressible curiosity: the less she knew about a thing,
the more she wanted to try it.  Thus she had elected to use
multithreading to improve performance in her log processing
utility, despite [[#121|master Banzen's cautions]].

Banzen reviewed her code, then invited the nun to discuss
his findings during the morning tea break.

When Satou had seated herself in the master's tea room,
Banzen picked up an empty bowl with his left hand while
his right hand took a ladle of boiling-hot water from the
pot and poured it directly onto Satou’s tatami mat.  Satou
yelped in surprise, leaping from the floor to avoid being
scalded.  The master calmly set the bowl in the center of
the spreading puddle as his right hand beat the puddle with
a whisk.  Then his left hand reached for a bamboo scoop
and began to spoon green tea powder into the dry bowl.

"Now," said Banzen.  "Let us discuss race conditions."

But first, sit down and come in.

Flowing from my brush //
Glowing on my screen //
Four lines readable in any order //
The essence of thread safety //

When Satou had seated herself in the master's tea room,
Banzen took a ladle of boiling-hot water from the iron pot
and poured it directly onto Satou’s tatami mat.  Satou
yelped in surprise, leaping from the floor to avoid being
scalded.  The master calmly beat the spreading puddle with
his whisk as he set an empty bowl in its center.  Finally he
spooned powdered green tea into the dry bowl.
