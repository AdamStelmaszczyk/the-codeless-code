One cold Spring morning, the nun [[Yíwen]] encountered
[[#184|a certain monk]] standing in the middle of a bridge,
his face stained with tears as he gazed into the abyss
below.

"What ails you, brother?" asked Yíwen, concerned for the
boy's well-being; for he looked as though he might
take his own life.

"The futility of existence!" sobbed the monk.  "What is the
point of our labors, when their fruits spoil so quickly?
Nothing is forever.  Whatever I do, all will end in dust."

Remembering how master Banzen [[#68|once faced]] these same
dark thoughts, Yíwen removed the [[#151|immense scarf]] she
was wearing and secured one end to the low railing. "A good
bungee jump always clears my head," she said.  "There's
nothing like the plunge to restore one's perspective, don't
you agree?"  She tied the other end tight around the monk's
ankles, and before he could ask what /bungee/ meant
she pushed him over the railing.

The monk screamed all the way down, certain of his doom.
The scarf went taut -- and stretched, and stretched.  His
fall came to a gentle stop a few dozen meters above the
rocks.  The monk burst out laughing.

Hearing the sound, Yíwen smiled and continued on her way.

That night, Yíwen was approached by several of the monk's clan.

Said one, "Our brother wishes to know when you will
reclaim your scarf, and him along with it -- for he is still
dangling below the middle of the bridge by his ankles,
unable to move in any direction."

Yíwen nodded. "Then I have left him in a better state than
when I found him."

"So you will /leave/ him in this state?" asked another.

Yíwen shook her head.  "Nothing is forever," she said sadly.
