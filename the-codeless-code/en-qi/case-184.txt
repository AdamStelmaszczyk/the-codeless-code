Illus.0.title: "And all the little ants are marching / Red and black antennas waving / They all do it the same / They all do it the same way..."

[[Jinyu]], the Abbess Over All Clans And Concerns, was
inspecting the doings of her temple when she happened upon
one of the new mobile-application developers, toiling away
at his desk.  She peered over the monk's shoulder to see
what he was working on, but his screen showed only tiny
black squares pulsating on a white field.  Jinyu rapped the
monk's head lightly with her cane.

"Explain," said the Abbess, pointing her cane at the screen.

"I have devised a new sparse data structure," said the monk,
"and I wished to see if I could use it to implement an
efficient simulation of <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life">the
game of 'Life'</a>.

The monk tapped a button on his tablet's screen, clearing it to a
solid white.  He then drew a jagged black line across it
with a stylus.  When he tapped this same button again the
black line burst open, spreading across the display like
pixellated confetti.

Jinyu frowned.  "So this is 'Life', is it?"

The monk nodded nervously.

Jinyu cleared the screen as she'd seen the monk do.
Then she took up the stylus and wrote neatly across the display:

    ALL THE LABORS //
    OF ALL OUR DAYS

When she tapped the button again, the words immediately
putrefied and dissolved into a squirming puddle of black and
white maggots.  From the maggots rose swarms of black-pixel
flies: scattering, multiplying, clashing, dying.  Black
scavenger ants left the decimated corpses, gliding away
in unison to unknowable destinies at infinity.  In a short
time all that was left was a great white desert, where a few
lonely specks of dust quivered in a faint, invisible wind.

Jinyu gave the tablet back to the monk.
"A most accurate simulation."
