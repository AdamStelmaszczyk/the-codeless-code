Illus.0.title: Try not to call on him before 6am.

It is the duty of every monk to call upon master [[Kaimu]]
at least once during their time at the temple.  When the
master opens his door the monk must bow and ask: "What is
the great joy of stateless services?"

Without fail master Kaimu will reply: "Ten thousand guests
fed by a single grain of rice."

The monk must then ask: "And what is the great sorrow?"

Kaimu will reply: "The great sorrow of what?"
