Title: What It Says On The Tin
Names: Wangohan, Suku, Landhwa
Geekiness: 2
Topics: naming, refactoring

[[Wangohan]], a monk in [[Suku]]'s charge, had struggled
for two miserable days to divine the cause of a bug.  On the
third day, as he stepped slowly through his own source code,
Wangohan was illuminated.

With anger in his breast and a code listing in his hand,
Wangohan entered the cubicle of a monk named [[Landhwa]].
Wangohan slammed the pages down on Landhwa's desk and jabbed
his finger at a variable circled in red.

"There is a variable in this method named
<tt>completedOrders</tt>," fumed Wangohan.  "It was meant to
hold orders whose status is <tt>COMPLETED</tt>: this should
be evident from the name alone.  Why, then, did you add
<tt>FAILED</tt> orders to it on this line?  I had no way of
knowing that the variable's purpose had changed.
My latest enhancements have all been in error!

Landhwa yawned and sprinkled some cinnamon on his /hotteok./
"Creating a separate variable would have complicated my task.
And changing the name of the existing variable was not necessary
since it still holds completed orders -- for the most part."

Wangohan bowed coldly and went out.

Later that week, master Suku summoned Wangohan to her chamber.

"The monk Landhwa has been taken ill," she explained with
one eyebrow raised.  "Stomach cramps of a most unpleasant
nature.  The cause is unknown, but Landhwa whispered your
name weakly before his last dash to the lavatory."

Wangohan spread his palms wide.  "I have no idea what ails
the monk.  But in his pantry there is a jar labelled
'cinnamon' which I have recently been using to store my own
blend of that spice.  If he has tasted it, please assure
him that it is only cinnamon -- for the most part."

Landhwa = Chinese for lazy (懒惰)

Wangohan (완고한) =  Korean for stubborn

Could you not create a <tt>failedOrders</tt> variable, or at least
rename the existing one?"


Landhwa yawned and held up his left hand, extending the
fingers one by one:

"<i>First:</i> creating another variable named
<tt>failedOrders</tt> would have complicated my task.
/Second:/ <tt>completedOrFailedOrders</tt> takes longer to
read and more effort to type.
/Third:/ the existing name was not wholly inappropriate,
since a failed order is in some sense 'complete'.
/Fourth:/ changing variable names was not necessary to make
my code function properly.
And /fifth:/ it is a virtue to leave untouched that
which functions correctly, as our sister [[Zjing]]
will <a href="/case/54">agree</a>."

Landhwa bowed and went out.

Wangohan spread his palms wide. “I have no idea what ails
the monk. But in his pantry there is a jar labelled
‘cinnamon’ which I have recently been using to store my own
delightful variety of that spice, laced with powdered wolf’s
bane.”


Wangohan spread his palms wide.  "I have no idea what ails
the monk.  But in his pantry he /may/ have stumbled upon a jar
labelled 'cinnamon' which I have recently been using to
store my own variety of that spice.  If so, please assure him
that it is only cinnamon -- for the most part."
