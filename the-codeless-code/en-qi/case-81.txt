Walking the halls of his abbey late at night, master
[[Bawan]] came upon a monk in distress.  A morning deadline
was fast approaching, and after three all-nighters the exhausted
monk had dropped his only remaining coins into the soda machine without
first noticing the paper sign taped to it.  The sign read
<span style="white-space:nowrap"><tt>OUT</tt> <tt>OF</tt> <tt>ORDER</tt></span>
in large red
capitals.

"Can you fix it?" asked the monk, who knew of Bawan's skill
with primitive machines.

Bawan studied the machine for a moment, then crossed out the letters
of the sign and under them wrote <tt>DEFOOORRTU</tt>.
Immediately a soda can dropped into the chute.

Satisfied, Bawan continued on his way.
