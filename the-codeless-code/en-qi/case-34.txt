The priestess [[Suku]] was reviewing the software of her
novices when she found a module whose variable names
displeased her immensely.  Value Objects were called /vo/ or
simply /obj/, regardless of type.  Lists were named /list1/,
/list2/, etc.  The respective Iterators were called /i/,
/j/, and (for no fathomable reason) /x/.

The priestess strode into the temple kitchens where the
novices were preparing the evening meal.  She
unhooked an immense rice paddle from its peg, found the
offending developer, and let vent her displeasure on the
boy's backside.

/"What have I done?!"/ yelped the novice as the paddle
landed with a meaty smack for the tenth time.

"Invective!" answered the priestess. "Verb your expletive nouns!"

This scene was repeated each night until the novice
was enlightened.

Ōshakushi (Large Rice Paddle: A Symbol of the Buddha’s Salvation)
Ōshakushi

This rice paddle is 2.5 meters long and weighs about thirty
kilograms. As a rice paddle this large is rather novel, it
is considered one of Chion-in’s seven wonders. According to
legend, during the Ōsaka Summer Campaign of 1614, Miyoshi
Seikai, a Buddhist novice, used this rice paddle to scoop
rice for the soldiers. Also, since one “scoops” with a rice
paddle, it was placed at the Chion-in in order to save all
mankind and lead them to the Pure Land. The rice scoop also
symbolizes the depth of Amida’s compassion. (Note: in
Japanese, the words for “scoop” and “save/rescue” are both
pronounced /sukuu/, resulting in a play on words here).
