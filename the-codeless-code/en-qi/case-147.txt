The Temple's user support staff -- known as the
[[Clan of Infinite Sorrows]] -- had begun receiving complaints about a
particular Shopping Cart application.  Changes made to the
vendor contact information were visible immediately in the
database, yet some of the application's servers would
continue to display the old vendor data for days.  Master
[[Bawan]] was sent to investigate.

"Bounce that server," commanded Bawan when the most recent
complaint surfaced.  "Then have the user log in again."

"Your first action is the Last Recourse of the Desperate?"
asked the host-master [[Yishi-Shing]].

"My purpose is diagnostic," replied Bawan, his arms folded.

When the user reported that the information on his screen
was now up-to-date, Bawan dove into the UI code created by the
[[Spider Clan]], then the business layer built by the
[[Laughing Monkey Clan]], and finally the persistence layer
provided by the [[Elephant's Footprint Clan]].
Eventually he summoned one of the nuns of Elephant's Footprint.

"Do you know the way to the Lost Hermitage?" asked Bawan.

"I have never heard of it," said the nun.

"It lies high in the mountains to the North, yet was buried
under a SNOBOL avalanche many years ago," said the master.
"Some brothers of our order still labor there underground;
I require their assistance.  This parchment will lead
you to them."

Bawan gave the nun an old map showing the
location of the Hermitage.  He followed this with seven
days' rations, a fur-lined robe, a climbing pick, and a snow
shovel.  Then he hustled her out the door and with
Yishi-Shing watched her recede slowly up the Drunken
Serpent's Road.

"I am not certain," remarked Yishi-Shing, "but in /my/
memory the Lost Hermitage was abandoned a few winters ago, and
its monks relocated to a pleasant grotto at the foot of this
very mountain."

"Is that so?" asked Bawan, nonplussed.  "Well, I suppose
that's the danger of cacheing data forever in the drawers of
my old lookup-table.  Perhaps next time I shall print a
fresh copy."

Yishi-Shing nodded. "The error was understandable.  Paper is
expensive, and some things do change only rarely."

"It is not by accident that /rarely/ and /never/ are two
different words," said Bawan.
