Illus.0.title: And this is why none of the monks have any hair.

In the monk [[Landhwa]]'s current Java project, domain
objects in the business tier were fairly similar to their
corresponding form-input objects in the web tier.  Since the
property names were often the same as well, the monk had seized
upon reflection as an easy way of copying most of the
data from one tier to the other.  Master [[Kaimu]] heard and
chose to investigate.

After studying the monk's code, Kaimu withdrew a brass flask
from his robes, took a long sip, then lifted a tea-candle to
his lips and blew hard.  A streak of blue flame shot from
his mouth right past the monk's shoulder.

"What are you doing?" cried Landhwa, patting out the
flames on his robe.

"Lighting the seven candles on the far wall," said Kaimu.

Both men looked across the room at the scorched
paper screens.  Kaimu frowned, picked up his tea-candle and
wearily started across the room.

"Missed one," he explained.
