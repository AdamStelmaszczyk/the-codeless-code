Illus.0.title: I recently realized that since I was born before January 1st 1970, I'm older than time() itself.

The [[Clan of Iron Bones]] had just applied the most recent
upgrades to the Temple's servers.  After examining some files in
<tt>/usr/include</tt>, host master [[Yishi-Shing]] shook
his head.

A monk noticed and asked, "Master, do you spy some cause for concern?"

Yishi-Shing said, "The type <tt>time_t</tt>,
by which the current system time is obtained, has been
declared as a <tt>signed long</tt> -- a mere sixty-four bits."

Puzzled, the monk started the abacus app on his tablet and
rapidly flicked the beads.  "Such a number is capable of
representing well over two-hundred-and-ninety-two billion
years, forward or backward," said the monk.

Yishi-Shing nodded.

The monk continued, "According to our most learned scholars,
that is well past the lifespan of the Universe in either
direction."

"And this does not trouble you?" asked Yishi-Shing.
"Existence itself will cease in a countable number of seconds, and
even the makers of our operating system taunt us with this fact!"

The monk considered a moment and said: "Not long ago
<tt>time_t</tt> was only thirty-two bits, incapable of
tallying even two centuries past its inception.  The type
was expanded with only decades remaining before its
expiration.  I surmise that, sometime in the next
several billion years, we will receive another patch."

The master was comforted.
