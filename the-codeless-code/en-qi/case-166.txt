Illus.0.title: I recently realized that since I was born before January 1st 1970, I'm older than time() itself.

The [[Clan of Iron Bones]] had just applied the most recent
upgrades to the Temple's servers.  After examining some files in
<tt>/usr/include</tt>, host master [[Yishi-Shing]] shook
his head.

A monk noticed and asked, "Master, do you see some cause for concern?"

Yishi-Shing said, "The type <tt>time_t</tt>,
by which the current system time is obtained, has been
declared as a <tt>signed long</tt> -- a mere sixty-four bits."

Puzzled, the monk started the abacus app on his tablet and
rapidly flicked the beads.  "Such a number is capable of
representing roughly two-hundred-and-ninety-two billion
years, forward or backward," said the monk.

"And this does not trouble you?" asked Yishi-Shing.
"Existence itself will cease in a countable number of seconds, and
even the makers of our operating system taunt us with this fact!"

The monk considered a moment and said: "Not long ago
<tt>time_t</tt> was only thirty-two bits -- incapable of
tallying as little as two centuries.  The type was expanded
with only decades remaining before the Universe's
expiration.  I surmise that, sometime near the end of the next
two-hundred-and-ninety-two billion years, we will receive another patch."

The master was comforted.



{{*}} It is interesting to note that current physics predicts the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_death_of_the_universe">heat death of the Universe</a> in no less than 10^100 years, with a subsequent Big Bang arising perhaps in another 10^(10^56) years.  This means that in order to display our uptime in seconds right before rebooting the Universe, we would need time_t to have (3.32e56 + 30) bits.  Since planet Earth only has about 1.33e50 atoms to play with, we'd need about 2.5 million Earths (or roughly one G-type main-sequence star) to build a simple register alone.  Now, where can we get a G-type star?  Hmmmmm...
