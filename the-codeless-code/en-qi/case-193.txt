Three sisters from a poor family petitioned the abbot of the
[[Laughing Monkey Clan]] for admission to the Temple as
developers.

"I cannot hire any of you," said the abbot after he looked
at their résumés. "You do not have the necessary experience."

"But it is the same complaint everywhere we go!" protested
one of the sisters.  "How are we to /acquire/ experience
if we are refused entrance to every place that /offers/
experience simply because we /lack/ experience?"

Master [[Kaimu]] happened to be passing by and overheard this.
He said to the girls: "Desire is the root of
all suffering.  If you cannot do what you desire, then do
what you must, so that in your spare time you may do what
you truly love."

The master then departed, but the girls were not comforted.

Several months later the master came upon these same three
sisters sharing a humble meal in the village.  He asked them
how they fared.

The first said, "By day I do carpentry to pay the bills,
and by night I carve sculptures for my amusement."

The second said, "By day I sell fish to pay the bills,
and by night I practice dance for my amusement."

The third said, "By day I repair garments to pay the bills, and
by night I code little applications for my amusement."

Kaimu returned to the abbot and, telling him what had
transpired, said, "Admit the third sister to your clan, for
she has what we seek."

The abbot asked, "Should we not advise her elder sisters
to follow her example, that they might gain experience
and also be admitted?"

/"Null,"/ said Kaimu. "How can we advise them on 'what to truly love'?"
