Illus.0.title: People who would like the world to stop changing have not seriously considered the prerequisites for this.


A monk approached master [[Kaimu]], and said:

Master [[Banzen]] claims that your philosophy is flawed, for you will
give different answers to the same question.  Were you aware
of this insult?

No, answered Kaimu.

Later that day another monk approached Kaimu,
and said:

Master Banzen claims that your philosophy is flawed, for you will
give different answers to the same question.  Were you aware
of this insult?

Yes, answered Kaimu.


== Qi's commentary

Kaimu does not suffer from idempotence.


== Qi's poem

The ten thousandth year has come and gone, //
yet no one remarks its passing. //
A dead world hangs in the starry void -- //
no discord, no error, perfect at last.
