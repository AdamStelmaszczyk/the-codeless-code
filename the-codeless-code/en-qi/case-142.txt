Illus.0.title: Given enough eyeballs, all bugs will eventually say that they are full and cannot eat another eyeball.


<i>[[Banzen]] gathered the [[Spider Clan]] and said:</i> //
Master [[Suku]] is [[#139|too far away]] to oversee your next release, //
and there is no abbot left to guide you. //
How will you seek out the errors in your code?

<i>The first monk said:</i> //
Who better to know the faults of a pig than another pig? //
I will review my brother's code, and he mine. //
We shall be each other's eyes.

<i>The second monk said:</i> //
The pig may know itself inside and out, //
but only the chef can say if it is roasted well. //
I will trust the eyes of our testers, whose sacred duty is finding flaws.

<i>The third monk said:</i> //
The succulent pig may be roasted to perfection, //
but the chef's life is forfeit if the Empress wanted beef. //
I will demo the application to our customers, and trust their eyes only.

<i>The fourth monk said:</i> //
The chef deserves to lose his head if he sent an idiot to take the order! //
To trust others is to eschew responsibility. //
I will use the application day and night, and trust my own eyes.

<i>The fifth monk said:</i> //
Before you wait tables yourself, ask a physician if your hearing is poor! //
To trust oneself is to embrace arrogance. //
My automated unit tests will be my eyes.

<i>The sixth monk said:</i> //
It is a poor physician who judges the body by only examining the feet. //
Make the patient run a dozen /li!/ //
My automated web-crawler will be my eyes.

<i>The seventh monk said:</i> //
It is a pig's physician who judges the body by only what can be seen. //
Let blood and bile be gathered! //
My static code analyzer will be my eyes.

<i>The eighth monk covered his head with his robe, and said:</i> //
Seven roads begin here; this blind man must remain behind. //
Yet if seven go and say what they've seen, I will see further than any. //
All of these monks will be my eyes.

<i>Banzen remarked to his apprentice [[Satou]]:</i> //
The second monk does nothing. //
The eighth monk does nothing. //
What does your third eye tell you?

<i>Satou answered her master:</i> //
The nothing of the second monk has virtue, //
But the nothing of the eighth monk has eight times as much. //
The eighth should be the new abbot, and the second his servant.

Thus was the eighth monk elevated, //
and the second monk corrected.
