One mid-winter morning, when user logins had slowed to an
icy trickle and the mountain was peaceful beneath
its blanket of snow, host master [[Yishi-Shing]] left his
servers in the care of ten capable monks and set out to
inspect the state of a distant abbey.

Arriving, he found an unexpected whirlwind of activity.
Serious defects plagued the abbey's software.  User activity
caused minor errors throughout the
database; these errors were compounded by subsequent user
actions, ultimately spreading the corruption to
highly-sensitive tables.  Monks were poring over log files,
running emergency data repair scripts, arguing at
whiteboards, hammering away at workstations.  Desperate
patches were released at a frantic pace, resulting in
further disasters.

"What of testing?" asked Yishi-Shing.

"No time! No people! No money!" said the abbot, who
tightened the straps on his rollerskates and took
off down the hall in response to the ringing of another
alarm-bell.

Yishi-Shing returned to his own temple, lost in thought.

"How fares the abbey?" asked the monks of the
[[Clan of Iron Bones]].

"I saw no abbey," said Yishi-Shing.  "Only a field of cold
hard earth where monks dig furrows with their fingernails,
while oxen march behind and goad them on with plow-blades."

"Are the servers in order, at least?" asked one of the
monks.

Said Yishi-Shing: "Not servers; masters."
