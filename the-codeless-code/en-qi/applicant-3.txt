[[Aaradhya]] had barely passed beyond the borders of the village
when she heard a high voice shouting /Madam! Madam!/ from
behind her on the road.  A boy was chasing after her, waving
frantically.  As he skidded to a stop in the dust beside
her Aaradhya recognized him as one of the BASIC students
from the schoolyard.  He was about seven years old,
barefoot and shirtless, clad only in a loose pair of
beige trousers whose pattern had long since faded.  His hair was
straight and as black as Aaradhya's own, and his skin was
quite as brown, but his eyes were an astonishing shade of
green.

"Madam!" panted the boy.  "My grandfather wishes to speak to you!"
He took her hand and motioned her back down the road.

The grandfather was ambling towards them, holding the
scorching midday sun at bay with a ragged parasol.  His hair
was white, and like the boy he was dressed in pale
threadbare clothes whose colors had long ago been lost to
the elements.  When the two drew near he closed the shade
and greeted Aaradhya with a slight bow, palms touching
before his chest.  Aaradhya returned the gesture.

"That teacher is no good," said the grandfather, "and the
boy must be taught properly.  Otherwise he will end
up like his father, a broken man trusted only to create
spreadsheet macros and the occasional .BAT file."

"It is a common fate," acknowledged Aaradhya.

"I understand that you are a teacher of no small skill,"
continued the old man.  "Versed not only in BASIC, but
in the enviable arts of Java and C."

Aaradhya raised an eyebrow.  "My BASIC is regrettably out of
date.  And while it is true that I have completed my
apprenticeship in Java, I am far from being called master."

"Still, you exceed all others in this village.  Can you not remain
here for a while, to school those who desire it?"

"My own master had a saying," said Aaradhya.  <i>"The
MAX_VALUE of Byte may be envied by zero, but it is far from
the MAX_VALUE of Integer."</i> She ran a hand absently along
the fringe of her outer robe.  "Indeed, it is for such
type-promotion that I am travelling north.  The Temple of
the Morning Brass Gong is holding trials for new novices
this very month.  That is why I dare not linger even a day,
lest their few positions be filled."

"Ah!" lamented the grandfather.  "I have heard of that
temple.  So far away, and across the mountains too!  Would
it not serve you better to travel by some sort of wheeled
internal combustion engine?"

Aaradhya laughed.  "You may as well ask if it would serve me
better to sprout wings and fly!  Even if such a device
could be found in these provinces, I could not afford to
purchase it, nor the fuel to power it."

"Perhaps, perhaps," said the old man, smiling a
half-toothless smile.  "In Reechee there is a driver who
crosses the mountains daily in such a vehicle, a marvelous
conveyance that he fashioned from an abandoned train car.
He calls it a /bus/, for it shuttles many passengers in
parallel.  He and I are distant cousins, and I may be able
to convince him to take you on board without pay."  The
grandfather opened his parasol again and began walking back
toward the village.  "All I ask is that you school the boy
as we go."

"Reechee is a good three days away," said Aaradhya,
flustered.  "Twice that at the speed of your old legs.
And it's in the wrong direction!"

"Six days' walk plus two days by bus, against three weeks on
foot," replied the grandfather.  He drew the boy to his
side.  "In any language, the math is simple.  It may even be
done with Bytes."

Aaradhya stopped in her tracks; the old man ignored her and
continued on.  The boy glanced back a few times, but each
time the grandfather turned the boy's head forward again
with a firm hand.

"How can I be certain that your cousin will give me passage?"
Aaradhya called out.

"You can't!" the grandfather shouted without turning around.
He raised an index finger.  "Life is a probabilistic
algorithm, where optimal input can still produce bad
results.  But every minute we argue is a minute wasted, and
minutes are precious to us both."

The two figures vanished around a bend, and Aaradhya was alone.

She stood debating within herself for another minute more,
then cursed privately and ran down the road after them.
