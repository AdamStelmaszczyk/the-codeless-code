Illus.0.title: Suku used to hang out in university bars and bet the mathematicians that she could add zero to one and get a result strictly between one and two.  But then she found it was easier to just wait until they were drunk and steal their wallets.



Two monks approached master [[Suku]] to settle a dispute.

The first monk said, "I have proposed a truly elegant
design, but this monk says it is too complex and cannot be
maintained."

The second monk said, "I have proposed a truly simple
design, but this monk says it is too limited and
will not be useful."

Suku turned to her whiteboard and drew a large /phi/, thusly:





The first monk said, "I do not understand."

The second monk said, "Nor do I."

Suku replied, "You argue in booleans; in zeros and
ones.  Come back when you have learned floating point."


== Qi's commentary

[[Kaimu]] holds court over novices and masters, but they send
the real fools to Suku.
[[#24|Kaimu's <i>null</i>]] can un-ask a bad question,
but Suku's /phi/ will undo two bad answers.

== Qi's poem

Kaimu has his /null/. //
Suku prefers her golden mean. //
The first commands reconsideration -- //
the second, compromise.
