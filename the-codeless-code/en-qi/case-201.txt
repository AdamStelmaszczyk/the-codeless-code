The [[Spider Clan]] had lost many abbots under master
[[Suku]], who had little tolerance for managerial
foolishness.{{*}}  But Suku was now travelling with her
apprentices, and the Temple had finally recruited its latest
replacement abbot: an outsider from the West named
[[Ruh Cheen]].

Ruh Cheen had been hired directly by Madame [[Jinyu]],
the Abbess Over All Clans And Concerns.
Since young master [[Zjing]] was currently assigned to the
Spider Clan, Jinyu called her in to meet the new abbot.

Ruh Cheen bowed clumsily to Zjing.  "I look forward to
supporting you in our shared mission," he said cheerily.  "I
see us as two big ugly mules pulling the same cart.  So I'll
do my best to stay clean out of your way, lest I trip you up
and we both find ourselves muzzle-down in the mud."

"That is... good news," said Zjing.

Madame Jinyu added, "Ruh Cheen is not only new to our Temple,
but new to software development as well.  His previous
position was managing a team of fish skinners."

"That is... less-good news," said Zjing.

"To me, a /java/ is something you drink, and a /tomcat/
is something you pet," said Ruh Cheen with a smile.  "So
I'll be depending on you to teach me the ins and outs of
whatever it is we do here."

"That is... wow," said Zjing, finding herself at a loss for
a suitable adjective.  "If you will both excuse me, I shall
inform the Spider Clan of this... news."

Zjing called her monks in to a private conference.
Their astonishment turned quickly to fear.

"How can this abbot hope to manage what he does not even
understand?" asked one.

"How can old Jinyu have hired him?" demanded another.

"Truly she wishes to punish us for having dispatched our
other abbots!" cried a third.

"If only we could have but /one/ of them back, to save us from
impending disaster!" lamented a fourth.

The hubub grew until Zjing called for silence.

"Madame Jinyu is no fool," she said.  "And it is not in her
best interests to set us up for failure.  Therefore it is
certain that her choice is best for the Temple.  If we
cannot see the wisdom behind it, then the only error is that
our eyes have not yet been opened.  Let us be patient, and
give this strange abbot our support.  By and by we will be
enlightened."

And as these words left her lips, Zjing herself was
enlightened.

Madame Jinyu summoned Zjing to her offices that evening.

"My spies tell me of your soothing words to the Spider
Clan," said the old Abbess.

"They were my words, but I did not believe them," Zjing confessed
in a low voice. "I wished only to restore order."

"And order was restored," said the Abbess.  "Why then does
little Zjing look so troubled?"

Said Zjing: "When I was elevated to master, I thought to
myself, <i>Speak the truth as you know it, and you will do
good service.</i> But today I learned that to do good
service, sometimes one must speak lies cloaked in the
semblance of wisdom.  What therefore is wisdom?  What
therefore is truth?"

Said Jinyu: "One evening long ago there was a great storm,
and my firstborn son ran to me afraid.  I told him that the
celestial spirits hunted nightmares in the rain; that each
bolt of lightning was a spear cast from the clouds, and each
peal of thunder was a demon's dying gasp.  We both slept
well thereafter.  My falsehood is easy to see, but a greater
truth hides in its shadow."


== Qi's commentary

I would confess that everything I have written in this
book is a lie, but I cannot, for there is not even a book.


== Qi's poem

[[Mugen]] asked Eku, <i>Have I grown fat and homely?</i>  //
[[Eku]] asked Mugen, <i>Have I grown pale and wrinkled?</i>  //
When lie answers lie, truth perishes -- //
Yet two old masters hold hands in the sunset.
