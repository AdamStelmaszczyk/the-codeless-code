The nun [[Satou]] approached Java master [[Banzen]] and said:
"There is a processing bottleneck which I believe I can
eliminate by means of multiple worker threads.  Yet I have
heard this proverb: <i>If you are confronted with a problem
and say, 'I shall use threads', you now have two problems."</i>

Banzen replied: "The saying is old, but not a true proverb.
In place of /threads/ I have heard <i>XML,
regular expressions, singletons, and AWK.</i>
It is merely a formula of one parameter which may be bound to anything
disagreeable.  There is more wisdom in the barking of dogs."

The nun considered this, and said: "So if you are confronted
with a problem and say, 'I shall use the Proverb of the Two
Problems', you now have two problems."

Banzen gave the nun a slight nod, which pleased her.  Yet he
also held up his index finger.  "That the words are hollow
does not make them false.  Threads are as the fabled Tsurugi
of Infinite Sharpness, whose blade can slice an enemy in
two while it is still a foot from his body, yet which
severs one finger of the wielder every time it is drawn
from its scabbard."

The nun asked: "How will I know when I have learned enough
to use threads wisely?"

Banzen replied: "When you no longer wish to use them."
