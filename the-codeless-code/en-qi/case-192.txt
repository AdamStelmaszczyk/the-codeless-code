[[#191|This same monk]] maintained a site
that sold agricultural tools to local farmers.  It lately had
caused these farmers much frustration, so the monk
resolved to follow master [[Bawan]]'s advice and offer the
[[#191|Four Words of Distress]] to his users as quickly as
possible.  For when an angry farmer wants to get his point
across to a developer, that point is usually at the tip of a
scythe.

The monk devoted his first sprint to providing /Help/
buttons throughout the interface, implemented as links into
the online user manual.  This, he thought, would take the
least time and effort -- and besides, farmers should
appreciate the value of low-hanging fruit.

But soon after deployment the monk found a note stuck into
his door, on the business end of a pruning-shears:

     Drowning, I cried out to your boat for Help. //
     You threw a heavy tome and rowed away.  //
     A friendly voice was all the rope I needed --
     Now I crave the sort that makes a noose.

The monk devoted his second sprint to providing /Cancel/
buttons throughout the interface, so that any action
of importance would only proceed after confirmation.

But soon after deployment the monk found a second note stuck
into his door, this one on the tines of a pitchfork:

     Asked, /Do you truly wish to cancel your order?/  //
     My only choices are OK and Cancel.  //
     I chose Cancel, yet received ten thousand pitchforks --  //
     I shall send one to your posterior... OK?

The monk devoted his third sprint to providing an
ever-present /Undo/ button, so that any action could be
reversed.  This took the greatest time and effort, yet he
was well-pleased with the result.

But soon after deployment the monk found a third note stuck
to his door, this one held fast by garden-spikes:

     The dog barks when the thief 
     

     yet my relief is short-lived -- //
          
     What
