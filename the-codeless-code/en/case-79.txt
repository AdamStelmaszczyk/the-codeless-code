A certain nun of the [[One Shoe Clan]] had run afoul of some
sample code in a PHP tutorial.  The sample contained
error-handling code which was not intended for actual
production use, yet this was not clear from the text.  The
nun copied the code dutifully, and disaster was the result.

When the crisis had passed, the nun found the old scribe
[[Qi]] writing in the Temple's great journal.
She bowed.  "Say something of instruction books that teach
bad practices."

Said the scribe, "I will petition the masters on this subject."

The scribe brought the nun's request to master
[[Suku]], who demanded readable code from all in her charge.

Suku said: "Books are faithful hounds, doing only as their
authors have raised them.  Some were doted upon, and
some sorely neglected.  If the Temple has been bitten, the
fault lies with the one who reared the animal.  His
writings should be cast upon the midden-heap."

The scribe brought the nun's request to master [[Bawan]], who
reverently stroked the binder of his ANSI C Handbook.

Bawan said: "Books are sleeping dogs, incapable of mischief on
their own.  Some are tame and some rabid, so all are
best awoken with caution.  If the Temple has been
bitten, the fault lies with the one who disturbed the
animal.  The nun should be punished."

The scribe brought the nun's request to the unhappy
master [[Banzen]], who sought perfection in all things
and seldom found it.

Banzen said: "Books are wild mongrels, taking part of their
nature from the writer and part from the reader.  If the
Temple has been bitten, the fault lies chiefly with the
animal's teeth.  The only correction required is one
done with ink."

The old scribe returned to the nun, and placed his great
journal in her hands.  "I have investigated the issue of
instruction books."

The nun found the most recent case, which appeared to be
unfinished.  "I see the testimonies of three masters," she
said, "yet all are in contradiction.  What will
you write in conclusion?"

The scribe barked three times and went out.
