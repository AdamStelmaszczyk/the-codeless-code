Illus.0.title: There is also a God of the Sudden Silence That Happens at Parties Just As You've Said Something Embarrassing.  He doesn't get many offerings.

The [[Temple of the Morning Brass Gong]] lay nestled in the
folds of a high mountain forest, shadowy and lush.  Hidden
among its thick well-tended groves were four shrines,
dedicated to four different gods of silence.

The monk [[Huisheng]] was paying his respects to the least
of these when a sandal fell from the sky onto the ground
before it.  The monk looked up and discovered a learnèd
brother -- bound, gagged, and hoisted by ropes to dangle
from the upper limbs of a cypress tree.  The prisoner was
frantically struggling against his bonds to attract
Huisheng's attention.

It was the habit of Huisheng <a href="/case/28">not to speak
unless spoken to;</a> and since the prisoner was indisposed
to speak at all, Huisheng merely turned away again and knelt at
the shrine, the better to contemplate the scene.

<i>-- I have heard much today,</i> thought Huisheng,
<i>concerning the state of a critical nightly batch job.</i>

<i>-- Many praised the design of the job; for it was said
that if any record could not be processed, a suitable email
was sent automatically to the Administrator and to all
Parties Concerned.</i>

<i>-- Many admired the reliability of the job, and how it was
common for days to pass with no such message being sent.</i>

<i>-- Many remarked upon the reticence of the job, and how
it sent messages only when it deemed there was some error in
need of correction.  This trait I find particularly
virtuous, yet the abbot taking tea beside me spoke of it in
tones of lament...</i>

Huisheng's thoughts were broken by the sound of muffled cries
from above.  Irritated, he cupped his hands over his ears.

<i>-- The Protocols tell us of no fewer than Four Silences:
the Silence Before Words, the Silence Between Words, the
Silence of the Broken Pipe, and the Silence of Fallen
Parcels.  To the initiate they are as different as the
characters for "end" and "not yet," although the outsider
cannot tell one from the other.</i>{{*}}

The unintelligible cries grew louder.  Huisheng looked up to see
a snake slithering along the ropes toward the terrified
prisoner.

<i>-- It is curious,</i> reflected Huisheng.  <i>The brother
above has not begged to be set free; nor has he entreated me
to pitch stones at the snake.  Soon he will be dead.  Then
he will continue to not-ask me these things, albeit in a
different way.  If I leave this place, he will not-ask
me in a different way altogether.</i>

<i>-- There is a lesson here in this monk's correction,
though I have not yet divined what it is.</i>

Thus, whistling a tune, did Huisheng depart the shrine.
